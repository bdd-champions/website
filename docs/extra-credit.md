### ğŸŒŸğŸŒŸğŸŒŸ Congratulations on getting this far! ğŸŒŸğŸŒŸğŸŒŸ

If you still have some time here's a fun excercise you can try:

**_People donâ€™t stand still. What should happen if Sean shouts when heâ€™s 1100m from Lucy and then shouts again when heâ€™s 900m from Lucy? What should happen if Lucy is 1100m away from Sean when he shouts, but some time later she moves closer to him?_**

Once you have decided how Shouty should behave, write scenarios to drive out this behaviour.
