# Take a look around

Now that you've cloned the Shouty project let's have a look around. Youâ€™ll find a single feature file in the `Shouty.Specs` project and youâ€™ll find programmer tests in one of the files in the `Shouty.Tests` project.

Weâ€™re going to take a look around and get to know what a typical C# SpecFlow test suite looks like.

There are only a few files here. Use the following diagram to help you decide what each file in the project is doing.

Are there any files whose reason for existing is not clear? Which ones?

:::

<details>
  <summary>
  
  The feature file contains scenarios made up of steps. Each step causes SpecFlow to look for a C# step definition to run. How does SpecFlow decide which step definition to run for each step?
  
  </summary>

Step-definitions are denoted by C# attributes: 

```csharp
[Given(@"Lucy is at {int}, {int}")]
``` 

Which match steps in the Gherkin like:

```gherkin
Given Lucy is at 0, 0
```
