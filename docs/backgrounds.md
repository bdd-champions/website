# Backgrounds

Sometimes each scenario in a feature file repeats exactly the same `Given` step(s). It can be useful to remove this duplication by placing them in a `Background` which gets run before **_each_** scenario. In our example Lucy is always at `0, 0` so we could move this step into a background.

```gherkin
Background:
  Given Lucy is at 0, 0
```

Create this background in your feature file and remove the references to `Lucy is at 0, 0` from all the scenarios. Run SpecFlow again to make sure itâ€™s all still working.

Remember, though, that the purpose of the feature file is to make the specification of the system easy to read. Moving steps out of a scenario and into a background can make it harder to read the feature file, because now each scenario now needs to be read in conjunction with the background.
