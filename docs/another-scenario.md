# Another Scenario

The product owner has come up with a new rule: **_"shouters should not hear their own shouts."_**

Write a scenario in the feature file that illustrates this rule.

:::tip discuss

- Does your new scenario pass?
- What stage of the BDD process are we at now?

## Get to green

Depending on what scenario you wrote, you might now need to implement new step definition(s).

You will certainly need to modify your production code to make your new scenario pass. Make sure you don’t break any of the existing scenarios.

:::tip discuss

- How long do you think the cycle of adding a new scenario and getting it to pass usually takes?
- Does your new scenario have a Given step that specifies someone’s location?
- Do you think that should be necessary?
